# Some experiments on ABS model 

- Scilab Xcos model based on MathWorks model https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/modeling-an-anti-lock-braking-system.html 
- More adequate parameters values
- Numerical implementation in C code
- Measurement of "adhesion utilization" according to my article and EU regulations
